# Just my learning Pandas and Numpy
This repo contains fewer things that i have learn about pandas and numpy to make my life easier and code faster.

I used Jupiter notebook for this example.

## What is in this repo?

### Pandas: 
1. Read file on csv/tsv format and present it on data frame.
2. loc and iloc
3. Data Manipulation

### Numpy:
1. Creating NP array from python list
2. Create numpy from stratch: indexing, random, slicing, multi-dimensional array, Reshape and traspose, broadcast and vectorize operations.
3. Data manipulation: aggregation, sorting, 
4. Standard Deviation and Variance


I am just a student and will continue learning this library.

Thanks Codexplore on youtube for this tutorials.
